## How to Use This Catalog

### Priority Levels

Each edge case is marked with a priority level:

- **🔴 CRITICAL**: Must be tested - could cause data loss or app crashes
- **🟠 HIGH**: Should be tested - significant impact on user experience
- **🟡 MEDIUM**: Nice to test - edge cases users may encounter
- **🟢 LOW**: Optional - rare scenarios

### Status Indicators

- ✅ **Tested**: Has automated test coverage
- ⏳ **Planned**: Scheduled for testing
- ❌ **Not Tested**: No coverage yet
- 🐛 **Known Issue**: Bug exists, tracked separately

## Known Issues & Regression Tests

### Controller Disposal Crash (commit 07058a2)

**Priority**: 🔴 CRITICAL
**Status**: ✅ Fixed & Tested
**Test Location**: Dialog regression tests

**Issue**: Dialog cancellation caused crash when disposing controller still in use.

**Fix**:
```dart
if (mounted) {
  WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback((_) {
    controller.dispose();
  });
}
```

**Tests Required**:
- ✅ All 6 dialogs safely dispose controllers on cancellation
- ✅ Rapid dialog open/close cycles
- ✅ Back button, outside tap, and explicit cancel
- ⏳ Verify pattern used app-wide (Phase 3.4)

### Dialog Overflow on Small Screens (Issue #246)

**Priority**: 🟡 MEDIUM
**Status**: 🐛 Known Issue
**Test Location**: Deferred to Issue #246

**Issue**: Some dialogs overflow on small screen sizes.

**Tests Needed**:
- ⏳ Test all dialogs on minimum screen size
- ⏳ Verify scrollable content
- ⏳ Verify proper constraints

3. **Create test** following patterns in `docs/EDGE_CASE_TESTING_GUIDE.md`
4. **Update status** to ✅ Tested when complete
5. **Link regression tests** if it was a bug
